# LeetCode-problems
This repo will house all the the LeetCode problems that I work on, along with test suites.

Notes:

STRINGS
Working with strings is messy, so many cases
using charCodeAt is helpful
Look into using Regex

DP:
When a brute force techniques require cubic time, traverse the array 3 times, think about using two pointers to traverse simultaneously, especially in a sorted array, so avoid traverse the array by one time (cubic -> quadratic)
